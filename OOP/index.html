# OOP

The OOP programming style in Javascript consist of three fundamental features:

* ### Encapsulation
A language mechanism for restricting access to some of the object's components.
* ### Polymorphism
Is the ability to create a variable, a function, or an object that has more than one form.
* ### Inheritance
Is a way to reuse code of existing objects, or to establish a subtype from an existing object, or
both, depending upon programming language support.

> One of the most confused mechanisms in JavaScript is the `this` keyword. It's a special identifier
keyword that's automatically defined in the scope of every function, but what exactly it refers
to bedevils even seasoned JavaScript developers. -- Kyle Simpson

---

# Context "this"

```javascript
var user = {
  firstName: 'Petya'
};
var admin = {
  firstName: 'Vasya'
};

function getName() {
  return this.firstName;
}

user.a = getName;
user.a(); // returns 'Petya'
showName.call(admin); // returns 'Vasya'
showName(); // returns undefined
              // in case 'srict mode' will throw TypeError: `this` is `undefined`
```

> `this` is actually a binding that is made when a function is invoked, and what it references
is determined entirely by the call-site where the function is called. -- Kyle Simpson

---

# Context "this"

There are 4 invocation patterns in JS:
* Default Binding

```javascript
function func() {
  console.log(this.a);
}
func(); // this is bond to the global object.
```

* Implicit Binding

```javascript
var a = {
  func: // some function
}
a.func(); // this refers to the object, i.e., a.
```

* Explicit Binding

```javascript
func.apply(thisArg, argArray); // this is bond to the first argument
```
* `new` Binding

```javascript
var func = new Func(); // this refers to func while in Func constructor
```

class: center, middle

# Constructor

---

class: middle

When a function is invoked with `new` in front of it, otherwise known as a constructor call, the following things are done automatically:

1. a brand new object is created (aka, constructed) out of thin air
2. *the newly constructed object is `[[Prototype]]`-linked*
3. the newly constructed object is set as the `this` binding for that function call
4. unless the function returns its own alternate **object**, the `new`-invoked function call will *automatically* return the newly constructed object.

---

# Constructor

Constructor is a function that creates and initializes the newly created object according to the
template.

```javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.canWalk = true;
}

var dog = new Animal("dog");

// dog = {
//   name: "dog",
//   canWalk: true
// }
```

The names of the functions that are designed to create objects, as a rule, begin with a capital letter.

---

# "Classes" in JS

Objects with identical methods of behavior creates class or object type (javascript). Class retains
constructive plan of own objects.

Each object - a member of a class, is an instance of class or object.

```javascript
function Clock(hours, minutes) {
  this.hours = hours;
  this.minutes = minutes;
  this.setTime = function(hours, minutes) {
    this.hours = hours;
    this.minutes = minutes;
  }
  this.displayTime = function () {
    console.log(this.hours + ":" + this.minutes);
  }
}

  var clock = new Clock(12, 30);
  var secondClock = new Clock(11, 45);

  clock.setTime(12, 45);
  clock.displayTime(); // 12:45
  secondClock.displayTime(); // 11:45

  console.log(clock instanceof Clock); // true
```

---

# "Classes" in ES2015

ES6 classes are a simple sugar over the prototype-based OOP pattern.

```javascript
class Clock {
  constructor (hours, minutes) {
    this.hours = hours;
    this.minutes = minutes;
  }
  setTime (hours, minutes) {
    this.hours = hours;
    this.minutes = minutes;
  }
  displayTime () {
    console.log(`${this.hours}:${this.minutes}`);
  }
}

var clock = new Clock(12, 30);
var secondClock = new Clock(11, 45);

clock.setTime(12, 45);
clock.displayTime(); // 12:45
secondClock.displayTime(); // 11:45

console.log(clock instanceof Clock); // true
```

  # Encapsulation
]

---

# Encapsulation in JS
Encapsulation is an increasing of abstraction, but not a paranoid hiding from “malicious hackers”
which, “want to write something directly into fields of your classes”.

It is a big (and widespread) mistake to use hiding for the sake of hiding.
ECMAScript 5, does not define private, protected, and private modifiers how it is in other OOP languages.
However, on practice it is possible to see something that is named “imitation of encapsulation in JS”.

```javascript
function Clock(hours, minutes) {
  var _hours = hours;
  var _minutes = minutes;

  this.setHours(hours) {
    _hours = hours;
  }

  this.getHours() {
    return _hours;
  }
}
var clock = new Clock(12, 30);
alert(clock._hours); // undefined, "private"
alert(clock.getHours()); // 12
```

---

# Encapsulation in ES2015

```javascript
const _hours = Symbol('hours');
const _minutes = Symbol('minutes');

class Clock {
  constructor (hours = 0, minutes = 0) {
    this[_hours] = hours;
    this[_minutes] = minutes;
  }
  set hours(hours) {
    this[_hours] = hours;
  }
  get hours () {
    return this[_hours];
  }
}
var clock = new Clock(12, 30);
console.log(clock.hours); // 12

clock.hours = 10;
console.log(clock.hours); // 10
console.log(clock._hours); // undefined

//But...
console.log(clock[_hours]); // 10 :( maybe WeakMap?
```
---

# Encapsulation in ES2015

```javascript
// clock.js
const _hours = Symbol('hours');
const _minutes = Symbol('minutes');

export default class Clock {
  constructor (hours = 0, minutes = 0) {
    this[_hours] = hours;
    this[_minutes] = minutes;
  }
  set hours(hours) {
    this[_hours] = hours;
  }
  get hours () {
    return this[_hours];
  }
}
// main.js
import Clock from './clock'

var clock = new Clock(12, 30);
console.log(clock.hours); // 12

clock.hours = 10;
console.log(clock.hours); // 10
console.log(clock._hours); // undefined
```

  # Polymorphism

# Polymorphism in JS

Objects in ECMAScript are polymorphic in several meanings.

"polymorphism" describes the idea that a general behavior from a parent class can be overridden in
a child class to give it more specifics. In fact, relative polymorphism lets us reference the base
behavior from the overridden behavior.

# Example

```javascript

class Cat {

  voice() {
    console.log('meow')
  }
}

class Tiger extends Cat {

  voice() {
    console.log('meow !!!')
  }
}

```

This technique is called "polymorphism", or "virtual polymorphism".

---

# Polymorphism in JS

Another aspect of polymorphism is that a method name can have multiple definitions at different
levels of the inheritance chain, and these definitions are automatically selected as appropriate when
resolving which methods are being called.

For example, one function can be applied to different objects, just like it would be the native
characteristic of an object (because `this` value determinate on entering the execution context):

```javascript
function test(o) {
  alert(this.a, this.b);
}

var o1 = { a: 10, b: 20 };
var o2 = { a: 100, b: 200 };

test.call(o1); // 10, 20
test.call(o2); // 100, 200

var a = 1;
var b = 2;
test(); // 1, 2
```

*** Prototype based model (Javascript) ***
.litle[
- the basic concept is an object;
- objects do not have the strict classes which describe
their structure and behavior; objects do not need
classes;
- objects are fully dynamic and mutable (and in the
theory can completely mutate from one type into
another);
- however, not having classes, objects can have
prototypes to which they can delegate if cannot answer
the message themselves;
- the object prototype can be changed at any moment at
runtime;
- in delegation based model changing prototype’s
characteristics will affect on all objects related with this
prototype;
- instances can have unique behavior (properties and methods).

.col-50[
*** Class based model (C++, Java) ***
.litle[
- to create an object first it is necessary to define its
class;
- the object will be created in its own classification
“image and similarity” (structure and behavior);
- being created, the class cannot to change a set of
characteristics (neither properties, nor methods) of
their instances;
- classes-descendants (and accordingly, objects created
from them) contain all properties of an inheritance
chain (even if some of these properties are not
necessary to the concrete inherited class);
- instances can't have unique behavior.
]

# Prototype

Unlike "traditional" class-based approach,
JS uses constructors and `[[prototype]]` objects as default extension mechanism.

You need to assign prototype object to constructor property called `prototype`,
and when you create a new object - this object will be automatically assigned as a prototype:

```javascript
var someObject = {
  name: 'test'
}

// create an object linked to `someObject`
var newObject = Object.create(someObject)

newObject.name; // 'test'
```

So, we have someObject that is now `[[Prototype]]` linked to newObject. Clearly newObject.name doesn't
actually exist, but nevertheless, the property access succeeds (being found on anotherObject instead) and
indeed finds the value test.

# But where exactly does the [[Prototype]] chain "end"?

The top-end of every *normal* `[[Prototype]]` chain is the built-in `Object.prototype`. This object
includes a variety of common utilities used all over JS, because all normal objects in JavaScript "descend from"
the `Object.prototype` object.

Some of them:
* `Object.prototype.toString()` - Returns a string representation of the object.
* `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()` - Returns a boolean indicating whether an object contains the
specified property as a direct property of that object and not inherited through the prototype chain.
* `Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf()` - Returns a boolean indication whether the specified object is in
the prototype chain of the object this method is called upon.

# Inheritance example

```javascript
var Person = function(name) {
  this.name = name;
};
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log('Hi, I am ' + this.name);
};
var Employee = function(name, title) {
  Person.call(this, name);
  this.title = title;
};
Employee.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Employee.prototype.constructor = Employee;
Employee.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log('Hi, I am ' + this.name + ', the ' + this.title);
};
var Customer = function(name, money) {
  Person.call(this, name);
  this.money = money;
};
Customer.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Customer.prototype.constructor = Customer;

var bob = new Employee('Bob', 'Builder'); bob.greet(); // Hi, I am Bob, the Builder
var joe = new Customer('Joe', 2000);  joe.greet(); // Hi, I am Joe
var rg = new Employee('Red Green', 'Handyman'); rg.greet(); // Hi, I am Red Green, the Handyman
```

---

# ES2015 version

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log('Hi, I am ' + this.name);
  }
}
class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, title) {
    super(name);
    this.title = title;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log('Hi, I am ' + this.name + ', the ' + this.title);
  }
}
class Customer extends Person {
  constructor(name, money) {
    super(name);
    this.money = money;
  }
}
var bob = new Employee('Bob', 'Builder'); bob.greet(); // Hi, I am Bob, the Builder
var joe = new Customer('Joe', 2000);  joe.greet(); // Hi, I am Joe
var rg = new Employee('Red Green', 'Handyman'); rg.greet(); // Hi, I am Red Green, the Handyman
```

In JavaScript, we don't make *copies* from one object ("class") to another ("instance"). We make *links*
between objects. For the `[[Prototype]]` mechanism, visually, the arrows move from right to left, and from bottom to top.

![figure](assets/img/fig-1.jpg)

This mechanism is often called "prototypal inheritance", which is commonly said to be the dynamic-language
version of "classical inheritance".
